<p>Everyday, we work on ideas that are highly complex and solve problems that are still a challenge to the entire industry. To do that kind of work, we understand the importance of having an open, inclusive and collaborative culture. Over the past few months, we’ve invested a lot of time in exploring and experimenting different areas where we could innovate in terms of creating the most effective company culture. </p>

<p>While these things sounds good on paper, it is far more difficult to implement, and adopt a new cultural idea in the company. But for the ones who’re joining our company, we use something called the BlackBook, which gives them a glimpse of what they can expect and how the company works. </p>

<p>We started working on the #OpenCulture project that encourages people to open-source their company culture to create one super huge book of culture to help other startups.</p>

<p>We are open-sourcing our culture documents and the contents of our BlackBook in this repository. Here’s what this repository will contain in the coming weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome letter</li>
<li>Our Values</li>
<li>Working with Passion and Working with Focus</li>
<li>Mission Statement</li>
<li>At-Will Employment</li>
<li>Code of Conduct</li>
<li>Remote Working Policy</li>
</ul>

<p>We will constantly approve pull requests and contributions to this repository. We believe that its very important to make the startups a better place, before we could make the world a better place.</p>
