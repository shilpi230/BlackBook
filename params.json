{"name":"Blackbook","tagline":"The secret handbook for Skcript.","body":"# BlackBook\r\n\r\nEveryday, we work on ideas that are highly complex and solve problems that are still a challenge to the entire industry. To do that kind of work, we understand the importance of having an open, inclusive and collaborative culture. Over the past few months, we’ve invested a lot of time in exploring and experimenting different areas where we could innovate in terms of creating the most effective company culture. \r\n\r\nWhile these things sounds good on paper, it is far more difficult to implement, and adopt a new cultural idea in the company. But for the ones who’re joining our company, we use something called the BlackBook, which gives them a glimpse of what they can expect and how the company works. \r\n\r\nWe started working on the #OpenCulture project that encourages people to open-source their company culture to create one super huge book of culture to help other startups.\r\n\r\nWe are open-sourcing our culture documents and the contents of our BlackBook in this repository. Here’s what this repository will contain in the coming weeks:\r\n\r\n- Welcome letter\r\n- Our Values\r\n- Working with Passion and Working with Focus\r\n- Mission Statement\r\n- At-Will Employment\r\n- Code of Conduct\r\n- Remote Working Policy\r\n\r\nWe will constantly approve pull requests and contributions to this repository. We believe that its very important to make the startups a better place, before we could make the world a better place.\r\n\r\n— [Karthik K](https://twitter.com/imkarthikk)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n- [Values](Values.md)\r\n- [Mission Statement](Mission Statement.md)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nWe encourage as many people as possible to contribute to this repository to create a better startup ecosystem before we could change the world. Here are some of the people who’re actively contributing to this repository:\r\n\r\n- [Karthik K](https://github.com/imkarthikk)\r\n- [Swaathi K](https://github.com/swaathi)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
